**Year**: 2007

**Genre**: Action adventure, Third-person (optional stealth) action

**Theme**: Medieval, Crusades, Templar order, Hashhasins, Levant, Conspiracy theories

**Developer**: Ubisoft Montreal

**Publisher**: Ubisoft

**Description**: The first title of a franchise of gigantic proportions, AC set the balls in motion for the trademark historical action game series of Ubisoft. It has revolutionary graphics for its time, fluid gameplay, and satisfactory joy of killing, if that is what you care for. You can stab, and slash, and chop, all your way till kingdom come, as far as this game is concerned. Although it is marketed as a stealth action game, it is basically like Hitman, and to use stealth, or not, is completely optional. You play the role of a disgraced member of the order of the Assassins, during the Third Crusade in Levant region surrounding Jeruzalem and Acre. After being stripped off your rank and status due to insurbordination, you must again rise up the ladder of the order to earn back your reputation and renown. For this you do the bidding of the order's leader, blindly following his commands to kill different leaders from both side of the war. AC is a cult classic, and must be played to truly relish the origins of this mega franchise even though it is not as interesting a game as more recent titles in the series.

#### Dishonored

#### Grand Theft Auto III

![Grand Theft Auto III Cover Art]( aurelius-reviews/images/GTA3boxcover.jpg "Cover art copyright of Rockstar. Source Wikipedia. Thumbnail image for commentary as per Fair Use policy"){:height="150px" width="110px"}

**Year**: 2001

**Genre**: Action adventure, Open world, Third-person shooter

**Theme**: Crime, Organized Crime, Gangsters, Mafia, New York City, Street Racing

**Developer**: DMA Design
**Publisher**: Rockstar

**Description**: GTA III is third installment and the first 3D title of the GTA series. This title is revolutionary in many ways, but most importantly as pioneer of OPEN WORLD and SANDBOX-style gaming. Although open world games existed before GTA III, this game put the feature right near the top of the list, from where it went on to become the most dominating characteristic found in almost all of today’s top of the range games. In this game you play the role of a wronged criminal on his quest for revenge. Betrayed by your own (very hot) girlfriend, you find yourself right at the bottom of the pile, from where you must rise up through the ranks… by doing petty crimes and driving around mob bosses in the beginning, but assassinations, heists, auto theft, racing, and every type of criminal activities you can imagine as you progress along the game. The setting is Liberty City, loosely based on New York City. You can drive cars or boats. You can roam around freely. Some parts of the city will unlock based on your progress through the story-line. Missions are given out by characters strewn around the city. Apart from missions, there are plenty of side-missions which will net you lot of money as well as excellent perks that are very useful for the story missions. If you are fan of open world, sandbox style gameplay, and do not mind challenges, you aboslutely must play this.

#### Gun

![Gun Cover Art](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/Gun_Coverart.jpg "Cover art copyright of Neversoft/Activision. Source Wikipedia. Thumbnail image for commentary as per Fair Use policy"){:height="150px" width="110px"}

**Year**: 2005

**Genre**: Action adventure, Third-person shooter

**Theme**: Wild west, Cowboy, Apache territory, Frontier

**Developer**: Neversoft

**Publisher**: Activision

**Description**: Considered by many as the best "western" themed game available, this is a short but solid game. You play the role of the archetypal cowboy hero, out to avenge the deaths of your friends and family, as you keep discovering more about your mysterious past along your journey. Although the story is conforming to a stereotype, it is conjured in a way unique enough to keep you interested till the end. Apart from the main story missions, you have an open world to explore on horse-back and plenty of things to do. You can hunt legendary wild animals, capture wanted criminals, enforce the rule of law, work for the regional pony express, help out a local rancher, or simply earn bucks by playing poker. Its a thoroughly fun packed game with the only downside being its short length. That should not however stop you from playing this!

| Control Scheme | 3/5     | Regular third-person, but some special actions and tactics with somewhat strange keybindings that do not offer better alternatives either    |

**Personal Opinion and Overall Experience Score**: 4/5

Thoroughly enjoyed this game. Biggest drawback is its short length. Loved doing the side missions. And even the missions in the same type were varied, so it never became repititive. My only serious complaint is the sudden spike in difficulty of the finale. The difficulty could have been ramped up instead of spiking so suddenly (and I had every upgrades and skills maximized). Otherwise, would love to see a new installment of this gem.
