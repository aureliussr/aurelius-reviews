**Personal Opinion and Overall Experience Score**: 4/5 *Enjoyable*

I pretty much enjoyed this game a lot, except the fact that luck and chance play a very important role in it. Since that is same IRL, I look towards games for a false sense of control. Since this game defeats that purpose, I had to simply retire from it.
