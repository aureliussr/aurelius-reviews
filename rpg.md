**Year**: 1996

**Genre**: Action RPG, Hack-n-slash, Dungeon crawling

**Theme**: Dark Fantasy, Angels and Demons, Hell and Heaven

**Developer**: Blizzard North

**Publisher**: Blizzard Entertainment (Activision-Blizzard)

**Description**: Considered as a pioneering cult classic and spiritual predecessor of the acclaimed Fallout series, this game is a rough diamond. It is very attractive in concept, superb in immersion and reaslism; but the gameplay mechanics have not aged well at all. Should be tried at least once by all RPG fans. You play the role of a desert ranger, leading a party of four to seven members, across post-apocalyptic Arizona desert. Your task is to investigate disturbances reported from the local settlements and towns, until you stumble onto a conspiracy much bigger in scale than you ever expected.

It's a very old game. Game mechanics are painful. Could not continue with it despite several trying several times. But the concept is attractive, which kept bringing me back again and again. Eventually I gave up though.

Arguably, the best ever hardcore action-adventure RPG to date, also one of the most immersive. An absolute must have for hardcore RPG fans. For me personally, it is still the best game I ever played.

#### Gothic

![TES III: Morrowind Cover Art](https://aureliussr.github.io/aurelius-reviews/images/Gothiccover.png "Cover art copyright of Egmont/Xicat. Source Wikipedia. Thumbnail image for commentary as per Fair Use policy"){:height="150px" width="110px"}

**Year**: 2001

**Genre**: RPG, Action adventure, Open world

**Theme**: Medieval, High fantasy, Magic

**Developer**: Piranha Bytes

**Publisher**: Egmont/Xicat (Nordic games at present)

**Description**: Gothic is one of the best RPG games ever created in terms of its story, progression, interactive environment, immersion, vast open world, and satisfactory combat system. It is also one of the hardest games out there with a very steep learning curve. In this game you start as a mere mortal human with no special skills or abilities. You work and slog your way up the ranks and soon become strong and powerful. You are thrown in as prisoner in a penal colony where everyone is held captive within a magical barrier, even the mages who originally were responsible for creating the barrier due to a malfunction during the invocation process. Soon after this disaster the prisoners inside the camp got rid off the guards inside and took charge of the place. They negotiated with the King of the realm outside the barrier and agreed to send the precious mineral magic ore in exchange for resources, food, drinks, and women. However some sects of the prisoners did not agree with this system and worked towards escape plans involving collapse of the barrier. This caused the formation of three different camps inside the colony with different goals and ideals. You have to join any one of them and proceed in order to find a way to make the escape plans work. In the course of gameplay you will hunt monsters, roam a vast open world, gather herbs and foods, learn magic if you want, fight with mighty orc warriors, and unearth an ancient mystery among several other activities. If you are a RPG fan, you simply must not miss this title!
