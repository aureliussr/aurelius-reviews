**Year**: 1996

**Genre**: Action RPG, Hack-n-slash, Dungeon crawling

**Theme**: Dark Fantasy, Angels and Demons, Hell and Heaven

**Developer**: Blizzard North

**Publisher**: Blizzard Entertainment (Activision-Blizzard)

**Description**: Considered as a pioneering cult classic and spiritual predecessor of the acclaimed Fallout series, this game is a rough diamond. It is very attractive in concept, superb in immersion and reaslism; but the gameplay mechanics have not aged well at all. Should be tried at least once by all RPG fans. You play the role of a desert ranger, leading a party of four to seven members, across post-apocalyptic Arizona desert. Your task is to investigate disturbances reported from the local settlements and towns, until you stumble onto a conspiracy much bigger in scale than you ever expected.

**Personal Opinion and Overall Experience Score**: N/A

It's a very old game. Game mechanics are painful. Could not continue with it despite several trying several times. But the concept is attractive, which kept bringing me back again and again. Eventually I gave up though.
