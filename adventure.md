**Personal Opinion and Overall Experience Score**: 2/5

Not one of my favorites, this one. Seemed pretty bland to me, and the plot is extremely cliched. However, *The Da Vinci Code* and the *Assassin's Creed* series came much later after this game. So this game deserves the credit of originality in considerable proportion.

#### Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
