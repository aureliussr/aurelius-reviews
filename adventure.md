**Personal Opinion and OVerall Experience Score**: 2/5 

Not one of my favorites, this one. Seemed pretty bland to me, and the plot is extremely cliched. However, *The Da Vinci Code* and the *Assassin's Creed* came much later after this game. So this game deserves the credit of originality in considerable proportion.
