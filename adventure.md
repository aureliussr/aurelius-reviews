**Personal Opinion and Overall Experience Score**: 1/5 *Forgettable*

Not one of my favorites, this one. Seemed pretty bland to me, and the plot is extremely cliched. However, *The Da Vinci Code* and the *Assassin's Creed* series came much later after this game. So this game deserves the credit of originality in considerable proportion.

Converted into a junk pile, the planet still remains home to a handful of determined survivors.
