**Year**: 2009

**Genre**: First-person shooter, Action RPG, Open-world

**Theme**: Sci-fi. Futuristic, Wasteland, Aliens

**Developer**: Gearbox Software

**Publisher**: 2K Games

**Description**: Borderlands is an experiment in blending RPG with FPS in an open-world setting which worked out really well. Its a charming shooter with every element of shooters in it, but also ensures a balanced level of sanity through its open-world and RPG features. In this game you play the role of a (or a group of in co-op mode) mercenary(s) with the mission of finding the legendary “vault” – a repository of advanced alien technology in the planet of Pandora. Pandora however have been mined and exploited by large interplanetary corporations through means of cheap convict labor. The corporations have left the planet releasing the convicts on their departure, which has resulted in bandit run madness and chaos. The convict turned bandits and Pandora’s dangerous wildlife make survival difficult in this planet.You have to get rid of such bandits and monsters in your quest for the vault. Eventually you will also have to face the military forces of one of the corporations who want the vault contents for themselves. Along your journey you earn skill points, learn new skills, upgrade your weapons (there are lots and lots of them) and gear, and become more and more fearsome.  The setting is the planet Pandora which consists of a vast post apocalyptic wasteland with some mountainous terrains, caves, and canyons. There are story missions and side missions which can be received from various characters or bounty boards strewn across the various in-game locations. There is vehicles for transport and a fast-travel system, although most mission specific locations are inaccessible to vehicles and have to be traversed on foot. Gears, weapons, and first-aid can be bought and sold in vending machines across the lands. If you like both FPSs and RPGs, then this is a must-play game for you.

A superb open-world game, blend of FPS and RPG. Lots of shooting, fighting, hunting, and explosions. Rewarding gameplay. Nevertheless, it did not quite leave a mark for me.

#### Far Cry 2

**Year**: 2008

**Genre**: First-person shooter, Open-world

**Theme**: Mercenaries, Soldier of Fortune, Africa, Civil war, Conflict daimonds

**Developer**: Ubisoft Montreal

**Publisher**: Ubisoft

**Description**: This is the second instalment in the Far Cry franchise of games, which had started off with critical acclaim through the original Far Cry game. Far Cry 2 ushered in the dawn of ultra modern FPSs with breath of new generation GFX, shooting and driving mechanisms, and open-world gameplay. Some innovations in terms of the buddy system and twisted plot generated good praises. You play the role of a soldier of fortune sent to civil war torn African country, in order to bring down a notorious gun smuggler, who is held accountable by the west as the one supplying both sides of the civil war with weapons and ammo. Unfortunately you get captured the moment you arrive and eventually also contract malaria sickness. Days later you are able to escape during a firefight between the two opposing sides of the civil war. Some existing foreign mercenaries help you get back to your feet, equip you with gear, transport, and safe-houses, and puts you in contact with one of the warring parties. From hereon you have to keep doing jobs for both the opposing parties, playing one side off against the other till you gather enough information to reach your target. Along your journey you befriend foregin mercenaries who become your buddies, and help you out during missions if you help them by performing side-quests for them. Although a innovative game achieving high levels of immersion, several serious issues makes it impossible for me to reccommend it.

**Personal Opinion and Overall Experience Score**: 2/5

I played this game over one to three incomplete playthroughs spanning 35 hours in total. The longest playthrough was probably for around 20 -25 hours. The game does have its plus points, the biggest being the immersion it is able to achieve, both through GFX and also gameplay. For example, the game uses a hand-held map which does not force you to leave the game screen, and GPS is realistic, the HUD is very minimal. You get seizures of malaria randomly, and if you use worn out guns, they jam while in combat. These elements help achive superb levels of immersion. However the game has some big problems. Firstly its plot is weak and alsmost inexistant. The map is so small that different missions keep happening in same locations. The repititiveness of the game becomes a pain after 20 hours and the progression is so sluggish that even after 25 hours you feel like you are just where you had started. Thus even after three diffferent attempts, I had to finally retire from this game.
